# Suika - A Physics-Based Puzzle Game

**Key Features:**
- **Physics Simulation:** Implemented realistic ball dynamics using Pymunk's physics engine, including collision detection and response.
- **Color Transition and Mechanics:** Designed a color transition system where balls 'evolve' through a series of colors and sizes upon merging.
- **Player Interaction:** Enabled player control for shooting balls and moving the character horizontally, as well as a cooldown mechanism to prevent spamming shots.
- **Visuals:** Integrated color-coded balls, background graphics, and a scoring system.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:** Managed game state, ball creation, merging logic, scoring, as well as a general challenge.

**Technologies:**
- **Pygame:** Game development and graphics rendering.
- **Pymunk:** Physics logic and collision handling.
- **Python:** Core programming language and handles game logic and functionality.
